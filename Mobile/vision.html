    <h6>Our Story, Vision and Mission</h6>
<p style="font-size:11px">Charles Dale Memorial International School is located at
    Igwuruta, Ikwerre Local Government Area in Rivers State. It
    occupies over 30 acres of land , the serene setting and the
    school’s modern buildings offer a privileged study environment.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px"></p>


<p style="font-size:11px">The school is co-educational and multi-cultural admitting
    students both nationally and internationally. It is strictly boarding
    and has standard living, learning and recreational facilities. It is
    recognised and celebrated for the strength of its programs, its
    warm and
    nurturing culture, and its strong sense of community. We are an
    established school that has worked hard over a number of years
    to
    provide good education to all our students and provide them
    with opportunities to develop. Our commitment is to know every
    student as an individual. Through strong leadership supported by
    governance we seek to foster the principles of team spirit,
    responsibility, and care for others. At the core of the school ethos
    is a determination to provide students with the resources to
    become critical thinkers and lifelong learners through an
    international, inquiry based programme of learning.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">The School is committed to an open admissions policy, and
    approximately 90% of the students have a mother-tongue other
    than English. There is a strong culture of acceptance of
    difference, and extensive support for the individual needs of
    students. The School has a very well-qualified and stable staff,
    and there is a strong commitment to investing in the professional
    development of teachers. We always aim to recruit staff that are
    passionate about teaching and learning.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">We have a dedicated team of both teaching and support staff,
    who ensure that our children enjoy a happy and caring
    educational experience within a secure, stimulating and
    purposeful environment. The expertise and experience of the
    Senior Leadership Team contributes greatly to the consistent
    strength of the school. The international staff reflect truly
    international flavor to the education provided and this permeates
    the curricular and co-curricular programmes offered.</p>


<p style="font-size:11px">The facilities are very good, and meet the academic,
    technological and social requirements of our students. Within the
    school we have well equipped classrooms, which are bright and
    spacious. We have interactive smart boards, a separate library, an
    ICT suite
    and several small group-working areas. CDMIS is frequently
    oversubscribed. Parents are more and more often obliged to go
    to appeal to gain a place for their child.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">The school is fortunate in having a strong and experienced
    Governing Board who share in the staff’s commitment to
    ensuring the long and short-term success of the school. They
    take an active part in school life as well as ensuring that the
    school remains a safe environment for all children to reach their
    full potential.</p>

<p style="font-size:10px">A world class citadel of learning with a reputation for excellence.</p>
<h6 class="text-primary" style="margin-top:20px">Our Mission</h6>

    <img src="Assets/img/dressing.png" alt="students" class="col-12">

    <h6 class="text-primary" style="margin-top:10px">Our Philosophy</h6>
    <p style="font-size:10px">Every student at CDMIS can develop new personal dimensions
        from our purpose designed environment. Students do not lose
        the essence of who they are, but become better citizens of the
        world. Viewing students as whole persons, the school is
        concerned with the spirit as well as the mind and body.
        Our approach to students is directed by the highest Christian
        ideals which include love and respect for one’s fellow man,
        service to the whole community; friendship, understanding
        and fair mindedness to all..</p>

        <h6  class="text-primary" style="margin-top:10px">Inclusive Statement</h6>
        <p style="font-size:10px">Instilling the highest level of discipline in all aspects of
            development of the students. Placing emphasis on individual
            student as we recognize that each child is unique being capable
            and able to excel diligently and with integrity.</p>


            <p style="font-size:10px">Exposing them to modern global teaching and learning facilities
                in order to prepare them for the world at large without them
                losing their cultural heritage..</p>

                <p style="font-size:10px">Enlightening them through seminars and workshops where
                    renowned external role models in society would serve as
                    guest speakers to counsel, educate and develop them morally,
                    socially, mentally and physically.Giving them the best pastoral
                    care. Being a full boarding community, students are developed
                    personally and guided by trained staff to be responsible young
                    people.</p>
